                    <p class="card-text">Pyinnyar Pankhin University for Kids (PPUK) is established in late 2022 in Myanaung, Ayeyarwady Region, Burma. Actually this university is not freshly instituted, there has already had a center with about three hundred students, called "Pyinnyar Pankhin English Training Center (PPETC), founded in 2015, with purposes of sharing Language and academic skills with children and the center becomes the university. The university is still a part of the Center.<br><br>
Since its inception, Pyinnyar Pankhin English Training Center has offered on-campus and online classes to children with the help of local teachers and international volunteer teachers. When Covid-19 pandemic hit Burma, all In-Person classes were canceled but online classes have been continued until now. Pyinnyar Pankhin Center offer free SAT classes, GED classes, and 4 skill English Classes with the help of American tutors.<br><br>
The idea of next movement is Pyinnyar Pankhin would start University for Kids, getting more subject areas of studies included rather than just giving English classes. This program is designed to offer in-demand skills, knowledge, and experiences to students for success in classes and in life. Some courses should be online, and some should be on campus.<br><br>
1.1 Course system model/structure<br>
• Course credit assignment<br>
• Course period (start and end dates)<br>
• Open course classification<br>
• Tracking students' performance/students' evaluation (tests, tutorials, exams, evaluation, etc.)<br>
• Teamwork, collaboration, synergistic effort, etc.<br>
• ***Course requirement sheet (core courses + elective coursesà total 100 credits)<br>
• Course credits (pass or fail) [This will be instructors' decision.)<br>
o Pass à earn full credit of the course.<br>
o Retry à need to repeat the class.<br>
o Teachers will have to submit a letter of report form to explain why "retry" credit is decided.<br><br>
2. Why take this course?<br>
The courses of the University for Kids are introduction to academic knowledge and practical skills. These are designed to improve analytical skills, synthesizing skills, and self-evaluation. Rather than memorizing facts in the books, the courses will help students to examine how to write and what to write based on the facts they have searched. This makes the students improve their analytical skills.<br><br>
And then, students synthesize personal observations, team-work and personal experiences and critical thinking for an original writing. All these improvements lead to self-evaluation because students will revise their performance and others' performance and further thinking is how to improve with better understanding of weakness and strength of own writing and thinking. With the help of the above practice, students will have cognitive skills for their academic and real life.<br><br>
*The word "Kid" means 8 years to 22 years old students should be. If the age of a student lies outside of this prescribed range, it would be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Arts and music are a part of life. Participation in the art classes will be useful in academic and real life because both lives deal with huge stress.

Students themselves learn online how to take a good picture. Other teacher available art subjects will be offered on campus.<br><br>
